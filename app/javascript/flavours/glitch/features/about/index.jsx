                If you notice that a member of hex.st is behaving in a way that
                violates either the core values or rules, or see content from
                another instance that goes against them, please let the moderators
                know either via the reporting system (click the "..." on a post
                and use the "Report..." option) or the admin email address listed
                above the rules. In particular, to flag issues with other
                instances, you can also simply tag @admin.

                Moderators will respond to these reports and/or take precautionary
                actions at their sole discretion, in the manner they deem
                appropriate, up to and including expulsion from hex.st and
                disclosing of the incident to other hex.st members or the general
                public. However, the identities of any victims will never be made
                public without their affirmative consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Such moderation actions can also be taken based on an individual's

                encouraged, the safety and well-being of victims and other members
                of hex.st will always be prioritized.

                    Mastodon allows you to view content from any other server in the fediverse; however, in doing so, you potentially expose all users from <i>your</i> server to that same content. Therefore, to protect members on hex.st, limits have been put in place to prevent communication with servers known to host hateful and harmful messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, some servers have specific goals and rules that make them prone to generating <i>lots</i> of posts â€“ for example, from generative bots. While for the most part there is nothing wrong with this, such servers will still be marked as "limited", so that the content they host doesn't inundate the timelines of members who don't explicitly seek it out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, as a general rule hex.st will limit communication with a server if it's apparent that its existence is motivated more by the profit of its creators than by the well-being of its users, and of the fediverse at large. This notably includes Threads, the server run by Meta: their past decisions demonstrate a pattern of prioritizing their business above their users' safety and privacy.

                hex.st was created, is maintained and moderated by a single person. (It's me, Robin!) As is the case for any Mastodon instance, and any online service really, this endeavor costs money and time. Here is what the financial breakdown looks like for <b>2024</b>:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Server hosting: $112 (this will decrease significantly in 2025)</li>
                <li>Domain registration/renewal: ~$23</li>
                <li>Object storage: ~$126</li>
                <li><b>Total: ~261 USD</b></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Time-wise, maintaining the server requires approximately one day of work whenever I upgrade it to a new version (accounting for breaks in functionality that need to be fixed), and a few days to a week for any more substantial changes like migrating to a new host, enabling new features, or tweaking the appearance of the instance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This, of course, is a significant investment, and any contribution is very welcome â€“ links to donation services are higher up on this page. But as long as these costs do not grow exponentially, the future of the server isn't endangered.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a situation were to arise causing me to be unable to afford maintaining hex.st any longer, I would do everything in my power to provide a sufficient window for members to save their data and migrate their account to another instance â€“ or transfer ownership of this place to a new admin. (Such a person would be thoroughly vetted, with an opportunity for members to voice objections and/or migrate elsewhere as well.)
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it is important to understand that I might not be <i>able</i> to do the above at all, for obvious reasons. This is a compromise you have to accept when joining and using a service run by an individual instead of a corporation.
